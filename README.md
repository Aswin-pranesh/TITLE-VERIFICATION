# TITLE-VERIFICATION
DISCRIPTION:
This project is designed to verify files by detecting duplicate or existing records based on their titles. The system scans the titles of files, books, or documents to check if they already exist in the database. If a title is not found, it will be added to the system. The primary goal is to identify and prevent duplicate or fraudulent entries, informing users whether a given title is already registered.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript
Frameworks: Flask or Django
NLP Libraries: SpaCy, NLTK
Databases: PostgreSQL

OBJECTIVES:
The main objective of this system is to reduce file duplication, which can cause redundant or misleading information to be mistaken for authentic. By detecting and blocking duplicates, the system enhances content accuracy and reliability, allowing users to access original, verified files while flagging fraudulent or unnecessary duplicates.
